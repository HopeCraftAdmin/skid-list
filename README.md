The official skid list. The following users are the scum of this community and shouldn't be dealt with as they will most likely screw you over somehow.

* ~~**"joeleoli"** - Uses leaked minehq libraries for his own shit and skidded bizarrealex and sucked his dick~~ <3 alex
* "NotAccursed" - Dishes out money for code and tries to re-sell it.
* "Edin", "breakcheaters", "C0DED", "configfile" - Dishes out money for code and tries to re-sell it.

* "Ambrosia" - Makes hub plugins for a living (LMFAO), has no idea what he's doing in an IDE, still using Eclipse in 2k18, and just talks shit about other people without having spoken to them before? Extremely toxic, DNDW.
* "BOMP" - Only has leaked MMC project files on his computer, works for free, and is dog shit at programming. Also doesn't use object comparison checks properly, and stores player objects directly instead of UUIDs (probably doesn't remove the player objects at all [memory leak gang]) - https://i.gyazo.com/fd5e2a8aa9a186c46727cc3ed2935a7f.png
